		<h2>This is my first article</h2>
		<p>What is life? According to me life is a box full of theories. Here theories means beliefs, way of handling situations and many more. Everyone has their own theories or understanding of life which they follow throughout their life and it keeps on changing according to the situations or surroundings. Sometimes you come across some new theories from your friends’ life and understand its importance in your life and may be want to make it one of your own as it is or with some modification suitable to you.</p>

		<p>Similarly, I came to know about one of the theory of my friend which I felt was quite right and it worked for me to solve the situation in my life. I am going to that share here, may be it gets added into your bucket too. Every situation or problem per say has 2 parts, 1 – whatever is under our control and 2 – what is not in our hand or may be the result of the situation. Most of the time during any problem, we put in more efforts on 2nd part and waste most of our time in it. Anyway we cannot control that part so we should be worrying less about it and work more over the 1st part which is mostly input from our side for solving any issue.</p>

		<p>So next time when you are going through any event, bifurcate the whole scene into 2 parts as mentioned above and work only on the 1st part. 2nd part will follow according to how you reacted for 1st part. This theory worked for me, you can also try and see if it works for you and later analyze it if it is suitable to go into your box of theories.</p>
